My first 'e-commerce' website with a Django backend. 

Possible Improvements:

1) UI very very basic, its very plain right now. Can be improved once I learn more about website designing
2) Currently users can upload only 1 image while creating a listing. In future versions i hope we can change that to have more images to be uplaoded.
3) No review/ star rating system implemented yet. I want to implement that.
4) Maybe ill make  history page for every user which stores a history of their previous bids, successfull auctions and items unsold
